My first end-to-end PowerBI project, where I have presented actionable insights to Electrohub (a fictional company) to aid stakeholders in taking data-driven decisions to drive business growth.

I extracted the raw dataset from Excel, transformed and cleaned them using Power Query editor and used a combination of various charts to visualize information, according to client requirements.

Learnt many things, including measures creation, using DAX expressions and STAR Schema modelling to link 3 Dimension Tables to a central Fact Table, where various important calculations were derived from existing data. 


Insights:

a)Weekend Flash sale is the most popular promotional category, since it offers a discount of ariund 23k to the buyers, while New Year special is the least with Rs 3k discount

b)Apple iphone 14 is the most profitable venture for the company, and TupperWare lunch box is the least. The sales of the iphone should be increased for more profitability.
